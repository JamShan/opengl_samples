=======================================
OpenGL Examples
=======================================

Some very simple examples of OpenGL on the PC
I have tried to make each sample about one specific thing as much as possible. Often building on that thing in Subsequent examples.

=======================================
Getting Started
=======================================

All The projects can be built on Visual Studio 2012 Express Edition


=======================================
Examples
=======================================
Check the folder names under samples for a hint at what each sample does

I will add more when i have time.

=======================================
Notes
=======================================
I am using the OpenGL Shader Wrangler (glsw) to manage the shaders
